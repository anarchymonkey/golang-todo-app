# golang-todo-app
This is a simple todo application made with React, Go with Gin. The aim of this todo application is to implement my learning of golang and have a strong understanding of how to implement crud operations using the Gin framework.


Use of frameworks is all well and good, but would also implement the same using go's http internal packages


## Tech stack being used
- [Go](https://go.dev/)
  - [Gin](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gin-gonic/gin)
- [React](https://react.dev/)
  - NextJs - Maybe when I learn Next (not a big fan of a framework on top of a library with a mastermind controlling it)
- Postgres/MongoDb - I would use *Postgres*, cause why not xD
